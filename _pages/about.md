Hello, my name is Suphakorn (Benz) Poobua. I am an M.S. student in geophysics at the Stanford Exploration Project [SEP](https://sep.sites.stanford.edu/), Stanford University. My research interests include distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), geothermal systems, full-waveform inversion (FWI), and space-based geodesy (InSAR).

Currently, my research focuses on developing scalable DAS algorithms to accelerate the cross-correlation process for efficiently constructing virtual shot gathers (VSGs). The primary objective is to reduce DAS data volume while preserving inner-product fidelity, which is critical for accurate cross-correlation. In addition, I aim to extend and enhance existing methodologies for shallow subsurface imaging across diverse environments, including urban characterization and geothermal exploration sites.
